# Session Handoff & Continuity Guide

## Purpose
This document ensures smooth transitions between AI sessions, preserving context and maintaining development momentum.

## Session State Management

### What Gets Preserved
1. **Current Task Context**
   - Active feature/bug being worked on
   - Progress status and completed steps
   - Pending tasks and blockers

2. **Recent Decisions**
   - Architectural choices made
   - Trade-offs considered
   - Rationale for approaches taken

3. **Learning Outcomes**
   - Successful patterns discovered
   - Failed approaches to avoid
   - Team-specific insights

4. **Environmental State**
   - Branch information
   - Modified files
   - Test results
   - Build status

## Handoff Protocol

### End of Session
```bash
# Automatic session summary
/project:end --save-session
# Creates: sessions/session_[timestamp].json
# Includes: Task progress, decisions, learnings
```

### Start of New Session
```bash
# Resume from previous session
/project:start --resume
# Loads: Latest session state
# Shows: Progress summary and next steps
```

## Session File Structure

```json
{
  "session_id": "unique-session-id",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-06T10:00:00Z",
  "duration": "2h 34m",
  "context": {
    "active_task": "Implement user authentication",
    "current_branch": "feature/user-auth",
    "progress_percentage": 75
  },
  "completed_steps": [
    "Set up JWT token generation",
    "Implement login endpoint",
    "Add password hashing",
    "Create user model"
  ],
  "pending_steps": [
    "Implement refresh token rotation",
    "Add MFA support",
    "Write integration tests",
    "Update API documentation"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Use RS256 for JWT signing",
      "rationale": "Better security for distributed systems",
      "alternatives_considered": ["HS256", "ES256"]
    }
  ],
  "learnings": [
    {
      "type": "pattern",
      "description": "Token rotation improves security",
      "application": "Implemented for refresh tokens"
    }
  ],
  "environment": {
    "modified_files": [
      "src/auth/jwt.service.ts",
      "src/auth/auth.controller.ts",
      "src/models/user.model.ts"
    ],
    "test_status": "passing",

  },
  "next_actions": [
    {
      "priority": "high",
      "task": "Implement refresh token rotation",
      "estimated_time": "2 hours",
      "context": "Use pattern from secure-jwt-implementation"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Continuity Best Practices

### 1. Clear Task Definition
- Always work with well-defined tasks
- Break large tasks into resumable chunks
- Document assumptions and constraints

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Use `/project:note` for important decisions
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Update documentation as you go

### 3. Context Preservation
- Keep CLAUDE.md files updated
- Document unusual decisions
- Note external dependencies

### 4. Handoff Preparation
- Complete current subtask if possible
- Leave code in compilable state
- Run tests before ending session
- Document any open questions

## Emergency Recovery

### Session Corruption
```bash
# Recover from git history
/project:recover --from-git
# Analyzes recent commits and branches
# Reconstructs session context
```

### Lost Context
```bash
# Rebuild context from codebase
/project:analyze --rebuild-context
# Scans code changes
# Infers current task
# Suggests next steps
```

## Multi-Session Features

### Long-Running Tasks
- Tasks spanning multiple sessions
- Automatic progress aggregation
- Milestone tracking
- Time estimation updates

### Team Handoffs
- Share session with team member
- Include additional context for others
- Highlight decisions needing review
- Flag areas needing expertise

## Session Analytics

### Tracked Metrics
- Session duration and productivity
- Token usage and costs
- Code quality trends
- Pattern success rates
- Learning effectiveness

### Improvement Insights
- Optimal session length
- Most productive times
- Common blockers
- Effective patterns
