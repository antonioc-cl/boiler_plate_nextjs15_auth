# Claude Code Development Assistant - Master Context

## Project Overview
This is the master AI context file for the Claude Code Development System. This file provides the foundational context that the AI assistant needs to understand the project structure, development standards, and workflow.

## System Architecture
- **Ultimate Hybrid System**: Combines expert analysis, intelligent automation, and continuous learning
- **3-Tier Documentation**: Foundation → Component → Feature documentation hierarchy
- **Intelligent Context Management**: Smart loading with relevance scoring and auto-pruning
- **Continuous Learning**: Pattern recognition and team knowledge sharing

## Active Configuration
- **Version**: 2.0.0
- **Mode**: Ultimate Hybrid with Intelligence
- **Learning**: Enabled
- **Team Sync**: Local Mode (configure for team sharing)

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start a new development session
/project:start "your task description" --intelligent

# Analyze existing codebase
/project:analyze --comprehensive --predictive

# Get insights and recommendations
/project:insights --my-dashboard

# Share patterns with team
/project:share --pattern="pattern-name" --with-team
```

## Project Standards
- **Code Style**: [Configure based on your project]
- **Testing**: Minimum 85% coverage required
- **Security**: All features must pass security audit
- **Performance**: Response time < 200ms for API endpoints
- **Documentation**: All features must have updated documentation

## Learning System Status
- **Patterns Collected**: 0 (new installation)
- **Team Members**: 1
- **Success Rate**: Building metrics...
- **Active Features**: Debugging, Prediction, Learning, Sharing, Insights, Audit

## Compliance Requirements
- [ ] GDPR: Configure if handling EU data
- [ ] HIPAA: Configure if handling health data
- [ ] PCI-DSS: Configure if handling payment data
- [ ] SOX: Configure if public company

## Session Management
Current session information and context will be maintained in the `sessions/` directory.

## Next Steps
1. Configure team settings in `.claude/team-config.json`
2. Set up MCP servers for enhanced functionality
3. Initialize learning system with historical data if available
4. Configure IDE integration for real-time assistance
