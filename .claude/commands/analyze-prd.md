# @analyze-prd

Analyze a Product Requirements Document to extract key requirements and technical considerations.

## Usage
```
@analyze-prd
```

## Actions
1. Parse PRD for functional requirements
2. Identify technical requirements
3. Extract constraints and dependencies
4. Map out component architecture
5. Identify potential challenges

## Template

I'll analyze the Product Requirements Document to extract key information.

## PRD Analysis

## Notes
- Thorough analysis prevents missing requirements
- Identifies technical decisions early
- Forms basis for all subsequent planning
