## Feedback Best Practices

### For Users
```markdown
## Effective Feedback Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**
   ✓ "The JWT pattern saved 2 hours but needs MFA docs"
   ✗ "Pattern was helpful"

2. **Include Context**
   ✓ "During payment integration, the error handler pattern..."
   ✗ "Error handling could be better"

3. **Suggest Improvements**
   ✓ "Would be great if patterns included performance benchmarks"
   ✗ "Needs improvement"

4. **Report Outcomes**
   ✓ "Implementation successful, 0 bugs in production after 1 week"
   ✗ "It worked"
```

### For the System
```yaml
Feedback Processing Rules:
  Priority Handling:
    Critical: Security issues, data loss risks
    High: Workflow blockers, major bugs
    Medium: Feature requests, optimizations
    Low: Minor improvements, nice-to-haves
    
  Response Times:
    Critical: Immediate alert to team
    High: Within 1 hour
    Medium: Within 1 day
    Low: Weekly batch processing
    
  Learning Integration:
    - All feedback contributes to learning
    - Patterns require 3+ confirmations
    - Negative feedback weighs 2x positive
    - Team feedback prioritized over individual
